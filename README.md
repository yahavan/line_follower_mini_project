# Line-follower using arduino
This is a simple line-follower mini project completed during my first year. 

## Overview
This robot follows black lines on a white surface. Two IR sensors were used to detect the path. Two motors were used. An arduino uno baord was used to process the inputs and control the motors. L293D motor driver shield was used to control the motors according with the arduino output. An old plastic CD case was used to hold everything together. Two 3.7V batteries were used to power the robot. You can find the source code made using arduino IDE and photographs of the product in the zip file in this repository.
